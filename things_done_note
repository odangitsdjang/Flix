1. Set up with rails new ... , npm init -y, npm save ..
2. Added extra gems, bootstrap: changed the application.css to application.scss and now need to manually import all css files
3. Added rspec, shoulda matchers; added users model/controller, session controller and following model (joins table). Made sure to test that everything here seems to be ok. Updated name to Flix.
